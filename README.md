# Evolution of Cooperation

This project investigates how cooperation can evolve in agent-based models. 

Uncontroversially, the main use of language is communication. In turn, one important function of communication is to coordinate cooperation.

## Simulations
The diagram below broadly illustrates the flow of all evolution simulations. Each generation has a fixed population size and each generation's agents are descendents of the previous generation.

### Interactions
During the lifetime of one generation, agents are repeatedly presented with food opportunities. Agents can choose three different options:
